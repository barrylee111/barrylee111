## Overview

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
  - A Deep Learning Model that will be able to predict whether or not a tornado will occur the next day and relay that prediction to the user via generated speech leveraging a TTS Model.
  - Chat Application that enables the user to deliver messages in real time, make audio phone calls that allows for voice conversion, make video calls, and upload an API Key from ChatGPT and leverage their LLM capabilities via text (can produce output with both audio and text).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently deepening my understanding of DevOps, MLOps, and security to support both of these efforts.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that will have an impact on the well-being of humanity.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm also an acupuncturist, herbologist, martial artist, and personal trainer.
